# Files List

  - [`kate.theme`](./kate.theme) — example KDE theme (“Kate”, MIT License).
  - [`boilerplate.theme`](./boilerplate.theme) — Highlight-style boilerplate (public domain).
  - [`UNLICENSE`](./UNLICENSE) — Public domain declaration for `boilerplate.theme`

# Introduction

Pandoc v2 introduced a new feature which allows to dynamically load a custom syntax highlighting theme file (JSON) via the `--highlight-style=FILE` option:

> Instead of a *STYLE* name, a JSON file with extension `.theme` may be supplied. This will be parsed as a KDE syntax highlighting theme and (if valid) used as the highlighting style. To see a sample theme that can be modified, `pandoc --print-default-data-file default.theme`.

Theme files are format-agnostic and they will work with all output formats that support syntax highlighting.

# The Default Theme

  - <https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/master/data/default.theme>

The default theme can be viewed at the above link, or generated by invoking pandoc with:

    pandoc --print-default-data-file default.theme

The generated file can be used as a reference to build custom themes.

# KDE vs Pandoc Themes

Pandoc uses KDE syntax highlighting theme files, but it’s worth noting that KDE themes contain more data than what is actually needed for pandoc usage. If you’ve found a ready-made KDE theme that you want to use for pandoc syntax highlighting, than the data excess isn’t a concern to you. On the other hand, if you’r building a theme from scratch, than you might be better off working with the boilerplate file provided here, which contains only the data needed for pandoc usage.

You can find examples of KDE themes at:

  - [github.com/KDE/syntax-highlighting/data/themes](https://github.com/KDE/syntax-highlighting/tree/master/data/themes)

## KDE Theme’s Data Excess

The problem with KDE syntax highlighting themes file is that that contain many keys which are not actually used by pandoc for highligthing. (See [Issue \#4096](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/4096))

For example, let’s look at the “Kate” KDE theme ([`kate.theme`](./kate.theme)).

Some members of `"text-styles"` have `"selected-text-color"` and `"strike-through"` entries, which don’t affect the ouput of pandoc highlighting:

``` json
    },
    "text-styles": {
        "Normal" : {
            "text-color" : "#1f1c1b",
            "selected-text-color" : "#ffffff",
            "bold" : false,
            "italic" : false,
            "underline" : false,
            "strike-through" : false
        },
        "Keyword" : {
            "text-color" : "#1f1c1b",
            "selected-text-color" : "#ffffff",
            "bold" : true
        },
```

Also, most of the name/value pairs in `"editor-colors"` (ie: 26 out of 28) are specific to the Kate Editor, and will not affect pandoc syntax-highlighting:

``` json
    "editor-colors": {
        "background-color" : "#ffffff",
        "code-folding" : "#94caef",
        "bracket-matching" : "#ffff00",
        "current-line" : "#f8f7f6",
        "icon-border" : "#f0f0f0",
        "indentation-line" : "#d2d2d2",
        "line-numbers" : "#a0a0a0",
        "current-line-number" : "#1e1e1e",
        "mark-bookmark" : "#0000ff",
        "mark-breakpoint-active" : "#ff0000",
        "mark-breakpoint-reached" : "#ffff00",
        "mark-breakpoint-disabled" : "#ff00ff",
        "mark-execution" : "#a0a0a4",
        "mark-warning" : "#00ff00",
        "mark-error" : "#ff0000",
        "modified-lines" : "#fdbc4b",
        "replace-highlight" : "#00ff00",
        "saved-lines" : "#2ecc71",
        "search-highlight" : "#ffff00",
        "selection" : "#94caef",
        "separator" : "#898887",
        "spell-checking" : "#bf0303",
        "tab-marker" : "#d2d2d2",
        "template-background" : "#d6d2d0",
        "template-placeholder" : "#baf8ce",
        "template-focused-placeholder" : "#76da98",
        "template-read-only-placeholder" : "#f6e6e6",
        "word-wrap-marker" : "#ededed"
    }
}
```

# Theme Boilerplate

  - [`boilerplate.theme`](./boilerplate.theme)

For the above mentioned reasons, I’ve created a [theme boilerplate file](././boilerplate.theme), containing only entries that are significant for pandoc usage (the boilerplate is released into the [Public Domain](./UNLICENSE)).

This boilerplate is a more manageable template for building a custom theme.

> **NOTE** — I haven’t been able to find much documentation on how pandoc/skylighting handle themes; so I’ve been relying on testing with theme files and on peeking at skylighting sourcecode.

## Usage Guidelines

Here are some guidelined on how to edit custom theme files.

  - You can safely delete any unneeded entry (ie: name/value pair).
  - You can delete `false`-valued boolean entries (they’ll be `false` by default).
  - The order of the entries can be changed.
  - Beware of the commas\! Missing or misplaced commas will cause the theme file to fail.

You might even add comments (or any custom entry) via extra string entries, as long as they are valid JSON — they’ll be just ignored\! Example:

``` json
    "Comment" : "JUST A COMMENT",
    "text-styles": {
        "Normal" : {
            "text-color" : "#ffffff",
```

… but you should avoid this in published theme files; it would only add confusion regarding theme’s standard. But in case you’re using some custom app or scripts to generate pandoc theme files, you should be reliefed to know that you could safely add custom entries for that app/script’s sake, without breaking a pandoc theme.

### The Metadata

The `"metadata"` section of the theme is entirely optional, you could even remove it and the theme will still work. But if you’re planning to share your theme with others you should consider filling it appropriately.

``` json
{
    "metadata" : {
        "name" : "boilerplate",
        "author" : "tajmone",
        "license" : "Unlicense",
        "revision" : 1
    },
```

  - `"name"` — Theme’s name.
  - `"author"` — Your name.
  - `"license"` — Theme’s license.
  - `"revision"` — Theme’s revision number (integer)

> **NOTE** — pandoc simply ignores this data, so you have quite some freedom of action here (you could add custom fields); try nevertheless to stick to the KDE standard as much as you can, for the sake of clarity.

### Text Styles/Token Types

All the members of `"text-styles"` represent [skylighting token types](#full-list-of-token-types), and share some common name/value pairs:

``` json
    "text-styles": {
        "Normal" : {
            "text-color" : "#ffffff",
            "background-color" : "#333333",
            "bold" : true,
            "italic" : true,
            "underline" : true
        },
```

… where `"Normal"` correspond to the “Normal” token type, and so on.

I’ve filled all text-styles with the same sample-data set, which is usually more than you’ll ever need. Dummy color values are provided as placeholders. You should edit color values to your needs, and remove any unwanted attributes, including boolean “`false`” values (you can delete the whole entry, as `false` is the defaul value of missing entries).

The idea is to avoid copy-&-paste operations: everything you might need for any text-style is there, remove what you don’t need. It seemed better to me than having a single entry with the data, and then have to copy and paste over what was needed.

For example, if you wanted Constants to be shown in red (`#ff0000`) and **bold**, you’d only keep:

``` json
        "Constant" : {
            "text-color" : "#ff0000",
            "bold" : true,
        },
```

> **NOTE** — Color definitions must be hex value strings, in the “`#00ff00`” format — color names like `"red"` are not allowed, nor are RGB color definitions.

### Editor-Colors Section

By lookin at [skylighting source code](https://github.com/jgm/skylighting/blob/0.4.4/src/Skylighting/Types.hs#L339) (`v0.4.4`), it seems that these are the only meaningful entries in `"editor-colors"`:

``` json
    "editor-colors": {
        "background-color" : "#000000",
        "line-numbers" : "#dddddd"
    }
}
```

Here is a descriptions of what is affected by members of `"editor-colors"`:

    "background-color" --- Codeblock and line numbers background color.
    "line-numbers" --- Line numbers color (unless "Normal" > "text-color" is defined)

The color of `"line-numbers"` will only be displayed if no `"text-color"` was provided for the `"Normal"` text-style, otherwise the latter will override the former\!
